Backend Dependencies:
    express: to build the server
    cors: to allow your React app to talk to the backend
    dotenv: to safely store API keys
    openai: the official OpenAI SDK


server\
|----index.js   -> main backend code
|----.env       -> API keys



Problems I have been facing while building this project:
|--- Insufficient Quota for Open AI, have to look for a free alternative (Using a Hugging Face T5 small model)
|--- Running out of provided memory on Render while using Hugging Face T5 small model (Running it locally on my device for now)
|--- Improving the response from model
|--- Not receiving any output even when button is clicked (solved it, still have to figure out how)
|--- The AI Model is too dumb to give an appropriate response (solved it using a better version of t5 model: flan-t5-base)
|--- Had to find a better model supported by transformers.js (HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct)
|--- Wondering how I can run the model on my GPU instead of CPU (still haven't figured that out yet)
|--- Backend hosting (thinking about Azure) (wtf is GitHub Actions Workflow)
|--- Error while building and deploying Node.js app to Azure Web App (./server -> server | Commenting out the test code from workflow file)
|--- Still facing some problem (could be the limited resources allocated to Web App Service)


New stuff I did in this project:
|--- Hosting backend on free service to hear to requests from Frontend hosted on GitHub Pages
|--- Hosting the backend on Render 
|--- Using Hugging Face Inference API instead of OpenAI API because it is free of cost 
|--- Using T5 model (Xenova/t5-small) capable of performing text2text (model wil run on render)
|--- Changed all the require statements to import because @xenova/transformers is ES Module
|--- Trying to use openai/gpt-oss-20b from Hugging Face (failed)
|--- Using HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct (better than Xenova/t5)
|-- Opened up task manger to monitor CPU usage while execution (100% for 3-4s)
|--- Using gh-pages library to host React frontend 




ATS-Assistant — React Web App (Frontend & Backend)

Developed a React web app leveraging Hugging Face AI to extract ATS-optimized technical keywords from job descriptions.

Built a Node.js/Express backend with a text-generation pipeline, handling real-time AI requests and managing CORS for frontend integration.

Implemented dynamic state management in React to capture user input and display generated keywords, enhancing UX.

Hosted frontend on GitHub Pages and backend on Render, optimizing model choice (T5 variants) for performance and response quality.

Troubleshot API integration, memory usage, and model limitations, ensuring reliable AI-powered keyword generation.
