Backend Dependencies:
    express: to build the server
    cors: to allow your React app to talk to the backend
    dotenv: to safely store API keys
    openai: the official OpenAI SDK


server\
|----index.js   -> main backend code
|----.env       -> API keys



Problems I have been facing while building this project:
|--- Insufficient Quota for Open AI, have to look for a free alternative 

New stuff I did in this project:
|--- Hosting backend on free service to hear to requests from Frontend hosted on GitHub Pages
|--- Hosting the backend on Render 
|--- Using Hugging Face Inference API instead of OpenAI API because it is free of cost 
|--- Using T5 model (Xenova/t5-small) capable of performing text2text (model wil run on render)
